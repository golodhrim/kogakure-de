INSTALLATION

This project has sample data.

1. python manage.py syncdb

This creates all database tables in an SQLite database and dumps some data in
the tables. It also creates a superuser:

User: test
Password: test

2. python manage.py runserver

This starts the development server on http://127.0.0.1:8000

You can visit the website in your browser. To log into the admin interface
point your browser to http://127.0.0.1/admin/ and log in with the test user.
